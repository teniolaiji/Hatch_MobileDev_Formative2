# Hatch 🐣

A Flutter mobile app that connects ALU students with startup roles posted by verified founders in the African Leadership University ecosystem.

---

## Features

### For Students
- **Discover roles** — real-time feed of open opportunities with match-score badges computed from your skill profile
- **Skill-gap analysis** — missing skills highlighted inline on every role detail screen
- **Bookmark roles** — save opportunities for later with instant O(1) Set-backed state
- **Apply** — structured application form with cover letter, availability, portfolio URL, and CV link
- **Track applications** — grouped by status (Reviewing · Pending · Decided) with colour-coded cards
- **Withdraw** — cancel a pending or reviewing application at any time
- **Post-acceptance reveal** — founder contact email and website unlocked on acceptance
- **Meeting cards** — view and join meetings scheduled by the founder, in real time

### For Founders
- **Post roles** — create opportunities with required skills, category, location, and deadline
- **Edit & delete roles** — update or remove a posting at any time via the overflow menu
- **Applicant count badge** — see interest at a glance on every role card
- **Review applicants** — cover letter, availability, portfolio, and CV link in one screen
- **Auto-reviewing trigger** — opening an applicant auto-advances status from `submitted` → `reviewing`
- **Accept / Reject** — one-tap decision with confirmation
- **Schedule meetings** — date, time, link, and optional note; appended atomically with `arrayUnion`
- **Contact reveal** — accepted applicant's email surfaces on acceptance

## Firestore Data Model

```
users/{uid}
  - email, name, role (student | founder)
  - skills[], interests[], experience[], education[]
  - aluCampus, aluProgram, aluYear
  - savedOpportunityIds[], isVerified, website

opportunities/{id}
  - startupId (→ users), startupName*, startupVerified*
  - title, description, requiredSkills[]
  - category, location, timeCommitment, deadline

applications/{id}
  - opportunityId (→ opportunities), opportunityTitle*
  - startupId (→ users), startupName*
  - applicantId (→ users), applicantName*, applicantEmail*
  - message, availability, portfolioUrl, cvUrl
  - status: submitted | reviewing | accepted | rejected
  - meetings[]: { scheduledAt, link, note }   ← embedded array

* denormalized for zero-join list queries
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK ≥ 3.0
- Dart ≥ 3.0
- A Firebase project with **Authentication** and **Firestore** enabled (Spark plan is sufficient)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hatch.git
   cd hatch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Connect Firebase**
   ```bash
   # Install the FlutterFire CLI if you haven't already
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

   # Configure for your Firebase project
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   This generates `lib/firebase_options.dart` automatically.

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### First-time Firestore setup

Hatch uses two user roles: `student` and `founder`. After signing up, set a user's `role` field in Firestore manually (or build an onboarding flow). To allow a founder to post roles, also set `isVerified: true` on their user document.

## Architecture Notes

**Why Riverpod 3?**
Providers are top-level compile-time constants — no string-based lookups, no context threading. `AsyncValue` handles loading/error/data uniformly. `.family` lets screens pass IDs to providers cleanly.

**Why denormalize?**
Firestore doesn't support joins. Copying `startupName`, `applicantEmail`, etc. into the application document means every list screen is a single-collection query — fast and cheap.

**Why `FieldValue.arrayUnion` for meetings?**
A read-modify-write pattern would lose concurrent entries. `arrayUnion` is atomic on the Firestore server, so two founders scheduling at the same moment can't overwrite each other.

**Why no `intl` package?**
To keep dependencies minimal. Date formatting uses lightweight static string-array helpers that produce the same output.

## Known Limitations

- No automated tests (the architecture supports them via `ProviderScope.overrides`)
- No push notifications — status changes require the user to open the app
- CV upload is a URL field (Firebase Storage requires Blaze/paid plan)
- No server-side full-text search — opportunity filtering is client-side only
- No feed pagination — all opportunities stream on load

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Firebase Cloud Messaging for status-change push notifications
- [ ] Firebase Storage CV upload (Blaze plan)
- [ ] Algolia / Typesense full-text search
- [ ] In-app chat between founder and accepted applicant
- [ ] Widget & integration test suite
- [ ] Founder analytics dashboard (apply rate, time-to-hire)
- [ ] Campus-specific role filtering using `aluCampus`
